# Wordpress theme for andersgoliversen.com

A minimal WordPress theme powered by Tailwind CSS. The code here is what runs on [andersgoliversen.com](https://andersgoliversen.com) and may be useful as a reference for building your own theme.

## Setup

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

The build step compiles `src/css/theme.src.css` to `assets/css/theme.css` and minifies JavaScript. Activate the theme in the WordPress admin panel after building.
